# Case Study :
# Health Care Data Analysis
# BUSINESS CONTEXT:
# The Cloudera Data Science Challenge is a rigorous competition in which candidates must provide a solution to a real-world big data problem that surpasses a benchmark specified by some of the world's elite data scientists,
# In the U.S., Medicare reimburses private providers for medical procedures performed for covered individuals. As such, it needs to verify that the type of procedures performed and the cost of those procedures are consistent and reasonable. Finally, it needs to detect possible errors or fraud in claims for reimbursement from providers. You have been hired to analyze a large amount of data from Medicare and try to detect abnormal data - providers, areas, or patients with unusual procedures and/or claims.
# The objective of the Cloudera Data Science Challenge 2 was to uncover anomalous patients, procedures, providers, and regions in the United States government's Medicare health insurance system.

# PROBLEM SUMMARY:
# The Challenge was divided into the following three parts, each of which had specific requirements that pertained to identifying anomalous entities in different aspects of the Medicare system:
# PART 1 : Identify providers that overcharge for certain procedures or regions where procedures are too expensive
